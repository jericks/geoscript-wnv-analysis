An example of how to use GeoScript Groovy to create a reproducible spatial analysis of the spread of West Nile Virus across the United States.

To run the analysis, you must have GeoScript Groovy installed.  You can then run::

    make

or::

    ant

depending on whether you have ant or make installed.

This example was demonstrated at FOSS4G 2014.
